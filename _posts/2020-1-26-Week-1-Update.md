This week, I have gotten my project approved and worked on the website, GitHub repository, and getting the initial version of my Unity implementation running.

## Website

This website is built on a free template called Minimal Mistakes for GitHub Pages. Learning and implementing the site is easy, but also a work in progress so consider some aspects right now to be under construction! I want to have a splash page which showcases an overview of my project. There is a roadmap available at the top header which will track my overall progress.

## GitHub
The repository can currently be accessed in the sidebar, under my name. which contains the relevant files for this website implementation as the Unity project.

## Refixtured
Refixtured is the tentative name for the project which means, according to Merriam-Webster, "to renew or replace the fixtures of (as a store, an office)".

## Unity
I have been learning the ins and outs of Unity. I have downloaded a few freely available furniture assets, but right now I am using a few primitive GameObjects to develop the foundation. Right now, the objects are being randomly arranged around the floor. The next step is to test to see if the object was placed where another object exists with collision boxes then try another spot.
