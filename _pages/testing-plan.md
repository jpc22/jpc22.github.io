The testing plan for this project seeks to accomplish and improve on usability, performance, and quality of results. This will be accomplished by distributing in-development builds by download or through the web browser and having testing participants answer a survey.

Each objective contains some sub criteria that help determine if they are satisfied. Unless noted otherwise, the objectives will be judged based on the responses to the user survey.

## Usability

- User interface is intuitive (i.e., user can use the program without explicit instructions.)
- Users successfully navigate from defining and entering parameters to viewing and saving the final result.
- The user does not find they need to repeat work from a previous session, meaning that the user's experience is consistent between sessions.

## Performance

- Bugs or implementation flaws do not hinder the program.
- The program cannot crash or fail based on actions of the user (e.g., unsanitized inputs.)
- The program performs adequately on a reasonable range of systems.
- Performance does not drop significantly under certain conditions (e.g., lots of furniture on screen.)

## Quality of Results

- The user is satisfied with the program's representation of rooms and furniture.
- The user feels that the algorithm's attempt to arrange the furniture was helpful.
- The user feels that the program helped solve a furniture arrangement problem. (e.g., found a new way to arrange their furniture)

## Miscellanious Testing

- The program will be tested and limits will be imposed on the maximum and minimum value of input parameters. These include room size, algorithm population size, furniture size, and furniture count.

## Testing Page

A dedicated page for displaying development builds and survey links will be added soon.
