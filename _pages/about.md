Refixture was developed in the spring of 2021 for a Computer Science capstone project by James Cunningham. The idea for this project came from a need to rearrange furniture without the sweat and planning of actually moving things around. Furthermore, learning about evolutionary algorithms brought up the idea that this process could be automated through a computer by testing out random configurations of the room. The initial proposal for this project can be read about [here](https://jpc22.github.io/blog/Project-Proposal/).

## Source Code

The [GitHub](https://github.com/jpc22/jpc22.github.io) page contains nearly everything about the project, with exception of some assets used in the release version. The program was developed using the Unity editor version 2019.4.21f1.

## Credits

This project was made with Unity and other open license assets and resources. Additionaly, it was designed as an open source non-commercial prototype.
